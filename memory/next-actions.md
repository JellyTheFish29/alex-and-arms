# Next Actions

## Current TODO

1. Wait for final category list and brand list from business owners (required input).
2. Wait for Google profile/account access needed for SEO workflow.
3. Once both are available, run a beginner-friendly keyword mapping session (simple, practical structure).
4. Then finalize URL architecture and redirect planning.
5. Then finalize homepage hero headline and page-level SEO briefs.

## Handoff Notes

- Memory system is now active via `AGENTS.md`.
- Continue appending conversation summaries in `memory/conversation-log.md`.
- Keep `memory/project-context.md` updated when goals/constraints change.
- Treat redirects as blocked until final URL map is approved.
- Preserve premium-accessible tone; avoid discount-led messaging.
- User preference: do not overcomplicate keyword mapping; keep process beginner-friendly.
