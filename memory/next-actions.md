## Current TODO

1. Finalize category list and brand list from business owners (required for keyword mapping).
2. Build Chennai-focused keyword map for pillar/category/brand pages.
3. Finalize URL architecture and then implement redirect system.
4. Finalize homepage hero headline after keyword mapping is locked.
5. Complete GBP + Google Ads access to validate local demand in Keyword Planner.
6. Draft page-level SEO briefs: title, H1, intent, section outline, schema, internal links.

## Handoff Notes

- Memory system is now active via `AGENTS.md`.
- Continue appending conversation summaries in `memory/conversation-log.md`.
- Keep `memory/project-context.md` updated when goals/constraints change.
- Treat redirects as blocked until final URL map is approved.
- Preserve premium-accessible tone; avoid discount-led messaging.
